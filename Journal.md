##Making a robotic arm
#By Griffin

Week one 
I had no idea what I was doing.  Then I fingered out how to move a servo 

Week two
I was able to make servos move to an exact position wheel holding a button after borrowing someone else’s code which became the base for my code.

Week three 
I ordered parts from amazon for the arm itself and ordered 2 more servos 

Week four
I built the arm this week and made the base of the arm 

Week five 
I tried to control the arm with a joystick didn’t work I also tried to add 2 more axis which also didn’t work.
